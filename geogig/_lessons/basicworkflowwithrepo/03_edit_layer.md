Now, that we have our personal branch, we can update the layer and synchronize
the changes to it.

The layer editing is done, as usual, using QGIS digitizing tools and
attributes editing. We will start by editing a geometry.

* In the **Layers Panel**, right-click the *Buildings* layer and select
  *Toggle Editing** to make the layer editable. In the **Digitizing
  toolbar**, click the node tool button to enable it. Use the tool to
  change the geometry of the feature in the center of the map canvas.
  For example, remove some vertices.

* From the **Attributes toolbar**, click the **Identify Feature** button
  to enable it.

* Then, click the edited feature.

* In the **Buildings - Feature Attributes** dialog, change any of the
  feature's attributes. For example, change the **DESCRIPTIO** field
  from `COMMERCIAL` to `RESIDENTIAL`, and set the **UPDATE_DAT** field
  to today's date. Click **OK**.

* In the **Digitizing toolbar**, click the **Save Edits** button, to
  save the changes you made.

Once you are done, click **Next step**.
