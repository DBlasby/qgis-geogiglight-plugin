Since we are working with others, it may be a good practice not to commit
changes directly to the master branch, at least not until all changes
are final. For that reason, we will create a new branch for your
edits, where you will be able to work and sync you changes without
affecting the master branch.

* In the **GeoGig Navigator**, if you haven't done it already, click any
  of the *Buildings2017_update* repo items to populate the **Repository
  History**.

* In the **Repository history**, expand the *master* branch contents to
  see all the branch previous commits.

* Right-click the top most commit from the list (which is the most
  recent), and select **Create new branch at this commit**

* In the **Title** dialog, enter the name for the new branch, for
  example *John_edits*, and click **OK**

Now, in the **GeoGig Navigator, if you expand the *Buildings2017_update*
repository, the you should be able to see the newly create branch.

In the **Repository history** you can confirm that, for now, both the
branches have exactly the same commits.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
