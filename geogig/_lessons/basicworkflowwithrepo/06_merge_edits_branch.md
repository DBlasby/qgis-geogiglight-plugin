Assuming that you are happy with all the changes, you can now transfer
them to the *master* branch.

* If needed, in the **GeoGig Navigator**, select the *building2017_update*
  repository so that it shows its branches in the **Repository
  history** below.

* In the **Repository history**, right-click the *john_edits* branch and
  select **Merge this branch into > master** from the context menu.

A message on the top of the map canvas will inform that the merge was
done successfully.

You can confirm that all the *john_edits* work was in merge into the
*master* branch by inspecting its commits list.

* In the **Repository history** expand both the *master* and
  *john_edits* branches. Confirm that all the commits that were
  previously only in the *john_edit* branch are now also available in
  the *master* branch.

This step ends the lesson, click **Finish**.
